# JSON-WEB-TOKEN

This is a JSON Web Token (JWT) library developed using TSdx. It provides three main functionalities: signing, decoding, and verifying JWTs. This library follows the Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach to ensure code quality and reliability.

> **Note:** This library is still in the development phase and is not recommended for production use.
> For a more mature and feature-rich JWT library, I recommend using Auth0 JWT or a similar established library.
